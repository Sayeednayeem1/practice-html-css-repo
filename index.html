        <h1 id="color-blue">Color, Background color!</h1>
        <h3>Surely we will use id and class!</h3>

    <div class="blue-beast">
        <h1 id="color-blue">Height, width</h1>
        <p>Now ofcourse we gonna use css in the heading and paragraph.</p>
        <p>But also we are gonna choose the height and width of them,,</p>

    <div class="blue-beast">
        <h1>Span tag</h1>
        <p>we use span tag to color a selected texts only,,</p>
        <p>Example: I want to color blue to <span id="span">This</span> as blue color.</p>
        <p>So basically you see the span tag worked really good</p>
